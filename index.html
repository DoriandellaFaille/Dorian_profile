  <h1>Hello ! My name is Dorian</h1>
  <h2>I am currently learning to program ðŸ˜‹</h2>
  <p>I am a junior product designer. I've always been interested in coding and generally understanding how things work, but
  I've never had the opportunity to focus on it. I feel that knowing how to code would be a great combination with my
  previous studies. I'm the kind of person who would be more likely to work as a freelancer or in a small company and for
  these positions, a more versatile profile is very interesting. The more I discover this field, the more it interests me
  and I would probably like to work as a web developer after finishing The Wagon, or at least part of my work should be
  about web design.</p>
